HW-10

In this assignment, we are called to create a node.js bot which will receive commands from the prompt and execute them returning the desired info.  There were three calls that could be made: a movie call, a song call and a twitter call.  For each the coding had to be setup to respond to the appropriate input and make that specific call.  The challenge was creating security keys, keeping them private and linking them to the right files.  This was not covered in class.  All went well (after some time), however, my Twitter calls stopped working after a while.  I decided to move on because it was working perfectly and then no more.  I could have created an entirely new account, but more important things were afoot.  All in all, this was a challenging but very rewarding experience.

An attempt was made to link this assignment to my protfolio.  I have modified the code to simply add the link.  It has yet to appear.
